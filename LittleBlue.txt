Once upon a time there lived a little boy, who we'll just call Little Blue.
Little Blue lived in a little village with a little bakery and in a little
house with his little mother. One day, Little Blue's little mother told
Little Blue to go to the bakery, to get a little loaf of bread to bring to
his little grandmother who lived deep in the woods. So he went to the
little bakery, bought a little loaf of bread and went into the woods...

Little Blue had a little bit of a journey ahead of him. He passed through the little logs andthe little brush. He continued through the little bridge on the little creek and past the 
little valley. His trip was quite uneventful until he heard a rustling noise in a nearby 
bush. He went to investigate...
