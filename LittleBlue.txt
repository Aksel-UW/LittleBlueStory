Once upon a time there lived a little boy, who we'll just call Little Blue.
Little Blue lived in a little village with a little bakery and in a little
house with his little mother. One day, Little Blue's little mother told
Little Blue to go to the bakery, to get a little loaf of bread to bring to
his little grandmother who lived deep in the woods. So he went to the
little bakery, bought a little loaf of bread and went into the woods...

Little Blue had a little bit of a journey ahead of him. He passed through the little logs andthe little brush. He continued through the little bridge on the little creek and past the 
little valley. His trip was quite uneventful until he heard a rustling noise in a nearby 
bush. He went to investigate...
	Little blue could not believe his little eyes, the thing creating the noise was little and blue just like him. He yelled out to it and said "What is something as little and as blue as me doing in the little valley?". The thing yelled back "Why the same little reason as you! My little grandmother lives back hear and needs her little loaf of  bread, she lives just past the river, will you help my little blue self get across?". Little blue responded, "Certainly I will, as for me not to help someone as little and blue as me would be a little weird.". Little Blue and his little friend began on the next step in their little journey.
